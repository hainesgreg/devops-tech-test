Observations 

The overall objective of this task is to upgrade a MySQL database by evaluation and executing some .sql scripts, using a programming language of choice from listed options. 

There are two docker containers, one where the script will be run from (exec_container) and the other housing the MySQL DB (mysql_container), both of which are connected on a default bridged network. The Docker containers are defined using a docker-compose.yml and a Dockerfile is used to assemble the images as theyâ€™re pulled from the remote repository.

Understanding of requirements (high level)

1. 	Check folders containing SQL scripts
2. 	Identify latest version in folder
3. 	Check contents of versionTable
4. 	Compare version number in db table against version numbers in folder
5. 	If db version is latest end script otherwise identify which scripts need to be run
6. 	Run scripts
7. 	Update the db version table to latest version numbers

Understanding of requirements (low level)

import required Python libraries
write function to connect to MYSQL DB (and cursor
write function to obtain DB version number
write function to get SQL scripts in list format and apply required logic
iterate through the list, If db version is higher do nothing, if db version is lower run the script AND update the db version.
end script

Connect to SQL DB from inside mysql_container to inspect MySQL DB

mysql -uroot -p123456
show databases;
use devopstt;
show tables;
describe versionTable;
select version from versionTable;

Other requirements
Make script executable (chmod +x <name_of_file>)
Expose port 3306 (update in docker-compose.yaml)
